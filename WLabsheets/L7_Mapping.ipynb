In this labsheet, we'll work with the idea of using a grid of 90x90 cells, providing a representation of 10x10mm per map grid cell.  \n",

Similarly, we might assume that cell `0,0` is the bottom left of the grid, whilst cell `89,89` is the top right.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we consider the above illustration, we can consider some initial problems our robot may face:\n",

        "- If the robot utilises the map with an unknown starting position, the robot may navigate out of the area represented by the metric map.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can consider several solutions for this metric map problem:\n",
        "- The robot could begin using the map, and then when the limits of the arena are detected, the entire map representation is updated with the correct coordinate offset to all mapped features.  \n",
        "- The robot could utilise a map representation that covers an area large than the task environment, although this is inefficient.\n",
        "- Different methods of mapping can be considered, such a topological or graph-based map.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even with the above considerations, we have an issue about whether the robot can autonmously detect the arena boundaries, and issues of localisation such as it's rotation with respect to a given global coordinate system.  \n",

Thefeore, you may need to write some code that uses time or an objective to decide when your robot has \"finished\" it's task, and then write the map to disk.\n",
        "  - You can use a similar method to write other information to disk for later analysis.  For example, you might want to create another `.csv` file to store information on odometry over time.\n",
        "  - You can use the code in `setup()` to add initial headers to your `.csv` file where it is appropriate. Within `.csv`, column headers are usually encapsulated in double-quotation (`\"`).  In C, you must use an escape character to create this formating:\n",

If your robot reports data into a cell on every call of the simulation, 1 cell will accumulate a lot of readings before the robot has moved to a new cell. "
