        "\n",
        "> \"A finite-state machine (FSM) ... is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The following example, also from Wikipedia, will also help us to understand how to implement a FSM for our simulated robot. An example of a simple mechanism that can be modeled by a state machine is a turnstile.\n",
        "\n",
        "A turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides, is a gate with three rotating arms at waist height, one across the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through. Depositing a coin or token in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through. After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considered as a state machine, the turnstile has two possible states: Locked and Unlocked. There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (coin) and pushing the arm (push). In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; no matter how many times the input push is given, it stays in the locked state. Putting a coin in – that is, giving the machine a coin input – shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked. In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state. However, a customer pushing through the arms, giving a push input, shifts the state back to Locked.\n",
        "\n",
        "The turnstile state machine can be represented by a state transition table, showing for each possible state, the transitions between them (based upon the inputs given to the machine) and the outputs resulting from each input:\n",

        "When designing an FSM, we need to step away from our human understanding of how the robot should behave. We need to decompose the desired behaviour into smaller parts which rely only on the information available to the robot. It may even help to imagine being the Romi robot with the sensors it has. We need to make sure we catch any assumptions about the robot, any ambiguity, and any potentially ambiguous circumstances. For example, what should your robot do as soon as you turn it on? The robot is fundamentally stupid, and we need to embody our intelligence with code.\n",
