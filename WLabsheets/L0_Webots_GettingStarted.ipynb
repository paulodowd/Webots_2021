In this unit, we are aiming our learning towards skills for microcontroller development.  In microcontrollers and embedded programming, C is still the dominant programming language because it provides close access to hardware, and it is the root understanding of other languages such as C++.  In this unit of study, we will gain some basic C programming experience which can be built upon later in your career.  Learning C through Webots will also make it easier for you to work with common platforms such as the Arduino.  Learning to program in C is a good thing!\n",

This is because the `main function` is a standard feature of a C program, and it is expected regardless.  When you learn to program, you will come across special cases such as this.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Second, you may apply previous discussion to notice that our main function has a `return type` of `int`, meaning it should provide a whole integer number of either positive or negative value when  it finishes.   If we read to the bottom of the code extract above, we also see the line `return 0;` which conforms to our expectation.  Therefore, the complete procedural operation of our program is contained within `main`, although we can expect it to call other functions, to iterate, and quite likely operate in a non-deterministic way.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Third, you may notice that the arguments of the main function are declared simply as `(void)`.  This indicates to the compiler that the main function will not receive any input arguments - no data will be given to the main thread at the beginning of the program.  If you explore other C programs, you will likely find some typical argument lists to receive data when the program is run.  In our case, we do not need this functionality.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A final general observation in overview is that you main function is `encapsulated` with curly-braces `{ }`.  In C, code within a function needs to be written within these curly-braces, and it is also important that the braces match.  For example:\n",
        "\n",

        "int main( void ) {\n",

        "```\n",
        "The above code will cause a compile error because we have opened a curly-brace after the `function name`, but then provided two closing curly-braces.  When you receive this type of error, the compile will often report an error message for another line of code, even if the line of code referenced is correct!  This happens because the curly-brace interferes with the order of the code being read by the compiler.  As a rule-of-thumb, it is good practice to check all your parentheses and curly-braces whenever you are in doubt.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Curly-braces must be opened and closed in a pairwise fashion.  When used correctly, it becomes clear what code exists within which function, and not confused with another function.  You may find C to be very pedantic (requiring exactness!) and annoying, but with experience it becomes reassuring.  Do not be afraid of error messages from the compiler, they will help you.\n",
        "\n",

Like this, `loop()` would be able to execute some other code whilst the count to 10 had not been completed.  In contrast, a loop operator within `countToTen()` (such as the example below) would have blocked `loop()` from running for a (very) short duration:  \n",
